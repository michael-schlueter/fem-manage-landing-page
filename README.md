# Manage Landing Page
> This project is based on a [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5) for Front End Mentor. The challenge was to create a landing page for a company called Manage. The design files were provided and the aim was to match the design and the features as close as possible.



## General Information
- I undertook this project in order to solidify my knowledge about working with plain CSS
- In particular I wanted to learn how to create a design system with custom properties and utility classes
- Another focus was to build the page mobile-first with accessibility in mind
- I strongly followed a YouTube tutorial from Kevin Powell to learn how he is tackling different challenges within CSS with modern and out-of-the-box solutions



## Technologies Used
- Vite 3.0.0
- a11y-slider



## Features
- Displaying information about a company
- Desktop / mobile versions
